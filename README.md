<p>I made updates and changes to the profile and account_settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Created two controllers 'ProfileController' and 'UsersController'.</li>
<li>The two controllers just pull information based on the currently logged in user.</li>
<li>FYI: If someone wants to see other people's profile, they won't be able to because
         I'm grabbing the ID based on the currently logged user. Let me know if you want me to
         change it.
</li>
<li>Also, about the controllers, I used the --resource flag even though it wasn't necessary.
    I just did it because of habit. I'm only using one or two functions in each of the two controllers
    at most.
</li>
<li>However, the project is still unfinished because I'm having trouble figuring out why when I upload
    an image, it doesn't copy the image from the storage to the public/storage/img directory. This
    code can be found in the 'UsersController@update' function.
</li>
<li>That's pretty much the gist of it. If you have any questions, please let me know.</li>
<li>I'm off to Santa Barbara for the day. I'll be back in the evening to keep working on it.</li>
<li>Let me know what you think of it so far. :)</li>
</ul>
