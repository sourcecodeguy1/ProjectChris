<p>I made updates and changes to the profile and account_settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Created two controllers 'ProfileController' and 'UsersController'.</li>
<li>The two controllers just pull information based on the currently logged in user.</li>
<li>FYI: If someone wants to see other people's profile, they won't be able to because
         I'm grabbing the ID based on the currently logged user. Let me know if you want me to
         change it.
</li>
<li>That's pretty much the gist of it. If you have any questions, please let me know.</li>
<li>I'm off to Santa Barbara for the day. I'll be back in the evening.</li>
</ul>
